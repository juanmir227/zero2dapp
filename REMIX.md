## ✅ Prerequisites

Before deploying your contract, ensure you have:

- MetaMask wallet installed
- Celo Mainnet added to MetaMask
- CELO tokens for gas fees (at least 0.01 CELO)
- Remix IDE account (optional, works in browser)

## 🚰 Getting CELO Tokens

You'll need CELO tokens on Celo Mainnet to pay for gas fees.

### Faucet Drops

Get your CELO tokens at [FaucetDrops](https://faucetdrops.io/faucet/0xb34D25c41df27D62e49f975b0E854d642c5F246E?networkId=42220). Get the code during the workshop!

### Adding Celo to MetaMask

If you haven't added Celo Mainnet to MetaMask yet:

**Option 1: Use Chainlist (Recommended)**

Add Celo to your MetaMask on [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/)

**Option 2: Add Manually**

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the network dropdown
3. Select "Add Network" or "Add a network manually"
4. Enter the following details:

```
Network Name: Celo Mainnet
RPC URL: https://forno.celo.org
Chain ID: 42220
Currency Symbol: CELO
Block Explorer: https://celo.blockscout.com
```

5. Click "Save"
6. Switch to Celo Mainnet network

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Open Remix IDE

Visit [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your browser.

### Step 2: Create Contract File

1. In the top right of Remix, click the GitHub connect to login
2. Then click the caret next to that login to clone this repo.
3. In the File Explorer, open the contracts folder and click on BuenoToken.sol to open it in the Editor.

### Step 3: Compile Contract

1. Click the "Solidity" on the icon panel to open the Solidity compiler
2. Click the Compile button.
3. Ensure there are no errors (warnings are okay)
4. You should see a green checkmark when compilation succeeds

### Step 4: Connect MetaMask

1. In MetaMask, ensure you're on **Celo Mainnet** network
2. Verify you have CELO tokens for gas fees
3. Unlock your MetaMask wallet if locked

### Step 5: Configure Deployment

1. Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab (left sidebar, third icon)
2. In the "Environment" dropdown, select **"Injected Provider - MetaMask"**
3. MetaMask should automatically connect
4. Verify that the connected account is displayed below the environment dropdown
5. Verify that "Celo (42220)" is shown as the network

### Step 6: Deploy Contract

1. Click the orange **"Deploy"** button
2. MetaMask will pop up asking you to confirm the transaction
3. Review the transaction details:
   - Gas fee should be displayed
   - Network should be Celo Mainnet
4. Click **"Confirm"** in MetaMask
5. Wait for the transaction to be mined (usually 5-15 seconds)

### Step 7: Verify Deployment

1. Once deployed, you'll see the contract under "Deployed Contracts" section
2. Click the dropdown arrow to see all contract functions
3. Copy the contract address (displayed next to the contract name)
4. Click the copy icon to copy the address

### Step 8a: Verify with the Contract Verification Plugin 
Try either Step 8a or 8b

1. Go to the plugin manager and activate the Contract Verification plugin.
2. Choose Celo as the chain 
3. Paste in you contract's address
4. Go to the settings tab of this plugin and in the blockscout section, paste in https://celo.blockscout.com
5. Go back to the main tab of the plugin and click **Verify**

### Step 8b: Verify on Block Explorer

1. Go to [Celo Blockscout](https://celo.blockscout.com/)
2. Paste your contract address in the search bar
3. Press Enter
4. You should see your deployed contract with:
   - Contract address
   - Deployment transaction
   - Contract creation timestamp
   - Balance (should be 0)

### Step 10: Save Contract Address
1. Pin your contract's address and copy the address as well.

**Important:** Save your contract address! You'll need it for:

- Frontend configuration (`.env.local`)
- Subgraph configuration (if using The Graph)
- Future interactions with the contract

Create a note with:
```
Contract Address: 0xYourContractAddressHere
Network: Celo Mainnet (Chain ID: 42220)
Owner Address: 0xYourOwnerAddressHere
Deployment Date: [Date]
Block Explorer: https://celo.blockscout.com/address/0xYourContractAddressHere
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to verify successful deployment:

- [ ] Contract compiled without errors
- [ ] MetaMask connected to Celo Mainnet
- [ ] Deployment transaction confirmed in MetaMask
- [ ] Contract address copied and saved
- [ ] Contract visible on Celo Blockscout
- [ ] Deployment transaction shows "Success" status
- [ ] Contract functions visible in Remix under "Deployed Contracts"

## 🎯 Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Update Environment Variables**

   Navigate to your project's `packages/nextjs/` directory and create/update `.env.local`:

   ```bash
   # BuenoToken Contract Address
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BUENO_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddressHere
   
   # WalletConnect Project ID
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id_here
   ```

2. **Restart Development Server**

   ```bash
   cd packages/nextjs
   yarn dev
   ```

3. **Test Contract Interaction**

   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/contract`
   - Connect your wallet
   - Check that your token balance displays
   - Try transferring tokens to another address

4. **Optional: Deploy Subgraph**

   If you want to index contract events:
   - Follow instructions in `THEGRAPH.md`
   - Update `packages/subgraph/networks.json` with your contract address
   - Deploy subgraph to The Graph Studio

## 🔧 Common Deployment Issues

### Issue: "Gas estimation failed"

**Solutions:**
- Ensure you have enough CELO tokens (at least 0.01)
- Check that you're on the correct network (Celo Mainnet)
- Try increasing gas limit manually in MetaMask

### Issue: "Invalid address" error

**Solutions:**
- Verify constructor parameter is a valid Ethereum address
- Ensure address starts with `0x`
- Check address is exactly 42 characters long
- Remove any spaces or extra characters

### Issue: Transaction pending too long

**Solutions:**
- Check [Celo Blockscout](https://celo.blockscout.com/) for network status
- Wait a few more minutes (can take up to 30 seconds during high traffic)
- If stuck after 5 minutes, try canceling and redeploying with higher gas

### Issue: MetaMask not connecting

**Solutions:**
- Refresh Remix page
- Disconnect and reconnect MetaMask
- Try a different browser
- Ensure MetaMask is unlocked
